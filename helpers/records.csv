"DJ Sotofett with L.A.2000, Ronny Nyheim & Zarate_Fix","WANIA mk2","Techno","12","WANIA returns with a super solid and very special club 12"" containing alternative mixes and non-album tracks from the upcoming ""WANIA mk1"" double album. This 12"" has 2 full tracks, 2 tracks ending in locked grooves and 5 further regular locked grooves! Ronny Nyheim & DJ Sotofett's ""Dubquartz"" which has been the secret weapon of LNS and Sotofett for years, is a chord riding anthemic Classic Techno big room track, leaving as much space for rhythmic punch as harmony. A-side also carries Zarate_Fix & DJ Sotofett's ""Dub State Looped"" a Dub Techno belter ending in a locked groove after 1 minute. On the flip Ronny Nyheim returns with ""EXP"" in a Sotofett remake discovering further Dub Techno territories before ending as locked groove. B-side also gives space to beautiful Balearic Ambient on ""1st Wave Fusion"" by L.A. 2000 & DJ Sotofett. With its 11 minutes of polymeter sequenced arpeggios, pads and synthesizer parts arranged with sonic drama not unlike the sunset itself. THIS 12"" IS CUT WITH LOUD VOLUME FOR EXCELLENT CLUB USE!","http://fett-distro.com/images/records/wania_mk2.jpg","2024-05-09T09:04:27.586Z"
"E-GZR","Metalurgic Funk Vol.2","Techno","12","ARTIST: E-GZR  TITLE: Metalurgic Funk Vol. 2  LABEL: WANIA CAT. NR: WANIA 9104 FORMAT: 12"" FILE UNDER: Techno  A1. no title A2. no title  B1. no title B2. no title  Metalurgic Funk Vol. 2 takes a short leap from Vol. 1, with all 4 cuts based around solid tonks of straight forward techno. Cutting 909-hat's, tunnel-visioning and simple but detailed slings of futuristic synths thread the whole record together. Pretention is left aside for upfrontness and most advanced interpretation of these looped bangers are left to happen in the listeners head while segueing into the core of techno.","http://fett-distro.com/images/records/wania9104_big.jpg","2024-05-09T09:12:25.301Z"

"Tech Droppers","Tech Droppers Vol.1","Electro","12","Tech-Droppers is the project of LNS & DJ Sotofett and this EP fronts a coil of six acidic, harmonizing, well programmed, whizzing and straight to the bone dance punchers. The string of snappy snares, rainy cymbals, steps of cuts & drops, as well as the sequenced balance of high flying chords, rolling rhythms and solidly sectioned stabs keeps all tracks absolutely straight to the point.","http://fett-distro.com/images/records/waniatd1_big.jpg","2024-05-13T14:04:28.767Z"
"Mala","Bury Da Bwoy","Dubstep","22","This record is my holy grail. Hunter is hands down my favorite DMZ tune ever. The percussion is so punchy and hypnotic. And that bassline!!! Bury Da Bwoy is sick as well, but Hunter takes the cake.","https://i.discogs.com/e6dWJ8eQG0znz41Ryjtc_NwQ6hsMyLPlCn_ufwH85M8/rs:fit/g:sm/q:90/h:600/w:600/czM6Ly9kaXNjb2dz/LWRhdGFiYXNlLWlt/YWdlcy9SLTg4NTk2/NC0xMTc0MzUxMjQ5/LmpwZWc.jpeg","2024-05-13T14:20:03.331Z"
