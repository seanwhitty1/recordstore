"DJ Sotofett with L.A.2000, Ronny Nyheim & Zarate_Fix","WANIA mk2","Techno","12","WANIA returns with a super solid and very special club 12"" containing alternative mixes and non-album tracks from the upcoming ""WANIA mk1"" double album. This 12"" has 2 full tracks, 2 tracks ending in locked grooves and 5 further regular locked grooves! Ronny Nyheim & DJ Sotofett's ""Dubquartz"" which has been the secret weapon of LNS and Sotofett for years, is a chord riding anthemic Classic Techno big room track, leaving as much space for rhythmic punch as harmony. A-side also carries Zarate_Fix & DJ Sotofett's ""Dub State Looped"" a Dub Techno belter ending in a locked groove after 1 minute. On the flip Ronny Nyheim returns with ""EXP"" in a Sotofett remake discovering further Dub Techno territories before ending as locked groove. B-side also gives space to beautiful Balearic Ambient on ""1st Wave Fusion"" by L.A. 2000 & DJ Sotofett. With its 11 minutes of polymeter sequenced arpeggios, pads and synthesizer parts arranged with sonic drama not unlike the sunset itself. THIS 12"" IS CUT WITH LOUD VOLUME FOR EXCELLENT CLUB USE!","http://fett-distro.com/images/records/wania_mk2.jpg","2024-05-09T09:04:27.586Z"
