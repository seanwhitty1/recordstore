"DJ Sotofett with L.A.2000, Ronny Nyheim & Zarate_Fix","WANIA mk2","Techno","12","WANIA returns with a super solid and very special club 12"" containing alternative mixes and non-album tracks from the upcoming ""WANIA mk1"" double album. This 12"" has 2 full tracks, 2 tracks ending in locked grooves and 5 further regular locked grooves! Ronny Nyheim & DJ Sotofett's ""Dubquartz"" which has been the secret weapon of LNS and Sotofett for years, is a chord riding anthemic Classic Techno big room track, leaving as much space for rhythmic punch as harmony. A-side also carries Zarate_Fix & DJ Sotofett's ""Dub State Looped"" a Dub Techno belter ending in a locked groove after 1 minute. On the flip Ronny Nyheim returns with ""EXP"" in a Sotofett remake discovering further Dub Techno territories before ending as locked groove. B-side also gives space to beautiful Balearic Ambient on ""1st Wave Fusion"" by L.A. 2000 & DJ Sotofett. With its 11 minutes of polymeter sequenced arpeggios, pads and synthesizer parts arranged with sonic drama not unlike the sunset itself. THIS 12"" IS CUT WITH LOUD VOLUME FOR EXCELLENT CLUB USE!","http://fett-distro.com/images/records/wania_mk2.jpg","2024-05-09T09:04:27.586Z"

Cutting 909-hat's, tunnel-visioning and simple but detailed slings of futuristic synths thread the whole record together.

"Tech Droppers","Tech Droppers Vol.1","Electro","12","Tech-Droppers is the project of LNS & DJ Sotofett and this EP fronts a coil of six acidic, harmonizing, well programmed, whizzing and straight to the bone dance punchers. The string of snappy snares, rainy cymbals, steps of cuts & drops, as well as the sequenced balance of high flying chords, rolling rhythms and solidly sectioned stabs keeps all tracks absolutely straight to the point.","http://fett-distro.com/images/records/waniatd1_big.jpg","2024-05-13T14:04:28.767Z"

"Dj Rush","Knee Deep","Techno","34","When this record came out it was like a bomb had gone off in our heads. Me and my mate (Luke Leslie - RIP, 'The Ron Hardy of Edinburgh') sat up for about three days and nights solidly without sleep just necking Es, smoking draw and listening to ""Lookin For Excitement"" non-stop, again and again and again. Then that Saturday when we had our club on (Soma @ Wilkie House) we must have dropped it at least half a dozen times and of course as the last track when the lights came on. Twice. With the crowd going more and more mental every time. Lucious Lon got played a few times n'all. We were just NUTS about that early Saber/Dance Mania/Chicago Bad Boys records. NUTS.  When that single octave comes in at 2.02 it's just WOAH!! Then when that - whatever the fuck it is - noise comes in at 3.55 it's just like FUCKING HELL!!! COME AWWWWWNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!! Bass up full...everything in the red...BANG THE FUCKIN WALLS!  Love this track so much I even recorded a 'tribute' to it called ""Lookin For A Rush"" . For my money, it's the best house track ever recorded (Video Clash being the closest contender), and I just live for the day i'll hear something else that will tear my head off the way this did. Ol' Mr Major may have lost the plot with all that Euro techno / schranz guff but nothing will ever take away his glory from creating this peerless masterpiece.  My definition of House Music.

Auf Konzerten fiel Malcolm Mooney zu dieser Zeit durch seine verwirrt wirkenden Darbietungen auf.

Das Album Tago Mago wurde nach der Insel Tagomago benannt.[2] Ein Teil des Materials entstammt Mitschnitten von Jamsessions.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81SCRg4nBfL._UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg","2024-06-03T16:39:33.315Z"
